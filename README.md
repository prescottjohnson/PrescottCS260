# HTML website

Basic HTML website to serve as the main view of your work in the course.

I have learned a lot about how html elements interact with each other. There were lots of times where I wanted to do something with css, but I would eventually realize that adjusting my html would give me flexibility in my css.

It has been helpful to work with javascript because now I can make my website interactive, and it will do things besides just displaying data. I can also make the user interact with the data on the screen. For example with my website there is a counter that shows how many likes there are. The user can change that just by clicking the like button.

It has been very exciting to work with services on simon. It is interesting that I can do something on my laptop, and then the same score results will show up on my phone. It's cool that they can communicate together and change what happens on different machines.
